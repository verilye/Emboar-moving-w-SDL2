## My experimentation with creating a game engine

### Game Engine
Helpful tutorial for setting up a basic game engine
https://dev.to/noah11012/using-sdl2-spritesheets-46h5

### CMake:

If setting up project on another machine, make sure to 'import' everything in Useful-Files
Needed by CMAKE to properly make a project with SDL

Compile and build setup with CMAKe
Setup in cmake
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cmake-linux
Go down to the bottom bar and select build in vscode
Press f5 to run current version of project

### Scripting:

Scripting for faster implementation?? Lua, C#, python?? (For building levels/ items / objects etc)

### Helpful Links:

Potentially use an already created game engine UI (NOT INGAME UI)
